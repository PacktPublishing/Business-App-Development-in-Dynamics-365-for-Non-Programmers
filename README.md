## About the Video Course
	
Hiring a developer to build a custom app, however small, is expensive. Microsoft PowerApps tackles this problem head-on and removes the programming aspect from app development. In this course, you will build visually stunning apps with intuitive user experiences — without writing a single line of code.

Using a Lawn Care company's dataset you'll be building canvas and model-driven apps with a configuration-based approach to managing processes and data. This will revolutionize your ability to collect, analyze, and act on data. You will also learn how to set up SharePoint team sites in order to improve document storage and collaboration and reduce the space used by PowerApps. Finally, you will connect Power BI to your data so it can be combined with other systems in your company and provide rich user experiences to your leadership team.

If you are a business user, manager, or consultant without any coding experience, this course will help you build and customize apps yourself!

By the end of this course, you'll be able to build new apps or customize existing ones entirely on your own, without having to call in any programmers.
